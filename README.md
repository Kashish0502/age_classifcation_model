# Gender Classification Model

## About
This project implements a deep learning-based gender classification model that classifies facial images into two categories: Male and Female. The model leverages the power of ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network known for its efficiency and accuracy, which has been fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of facial images.

The core idea is to extract discriminative features from face images and use them to determine the gender. The model can be used in real-time applications such as demographic analytics, personalized user experiences, and security systems.

Key Highlights:

- Based on ResNet-18, pretrained on ImageNet.

- Fine-tuned for binary classification (Male/Female).

- Optimized for accuracy and lightweight inference.

- Accepts input images of size 224x224.

- Achieves high performance on standard face datasets.





## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation was obtained from Kaggle. It contains labeled facial images categorized by gender: Male and Female.
